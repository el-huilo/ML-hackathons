# 0try ML-hackathons

This repository serves as a technical showcase of our team's machine learning solutions from various hackathons.

**Team 0try** (pronounced "zero try") is a group of students from Pacific National University, specializing in Computer Security. We participate in various technical competitions including CTFs, ICPCs, hackathons, and non-standard contests.

We will not indicate who contributed more or less to the solution, and will present it as the result of the team's work.

**Note:** This repository is maintained primarily for showcasing and educational purposes. While we strive for clean, well-documented code, please understand that hackathon solutions are often developed under time constraints and may prioritize functionality over production-level code quality.
